                    <p>I always had a passion for science, technology, and math, but it was when I took my first programming class in college that I was like &quot;Yup, this is what I want to do for a living!&quot;.</p>
                    <p>Programming has always been fun to me. I've always looked at it as a puzzle. Engineering has always fascinated me because engineers put together ideas and solutions from different fields to come up with one elegant and efficient solution. I've always loved the idea of having that power.</p>

                    <p></p>

                    <p>For you to understand my interests, we would have to talk about my childhood and how I always liked to learn.</p>

                    <p>Ever since I was little I found myself building stuff with whatever I could.</p>

                    <p>When I was 5 I would build pyramids and other shapes with blocks.</p>
                </div>



                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>When I was in elementary school I took apart a VHS rewinder, I put a wheel on the motor along with a few nails, and I had tons of fun shedding toilet paper rolls into confetti with one touch. That thing was powerful. I did other fun things with it including putting a string on it and watch it dance, I made a fan (basic), but the fun tragically ended when I tried to put it on a boat I built with plastic bottles.</p>
                </div>



                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>When I discovered speakers work the same way bulbs do, I found out they can work together when they are connected to the same circuit. My friends were impressed with what I did with speakers and a few christmas lights.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="subsection">
                <p>In High School I got my first iPod from my friend who was annoyed he could only listen to music with one ear because he had to hold the headphone jack to one side in order for it to work properly so he wanted to get rid of it. I fixed it by making a lever that held it in place using a paperclip and tape.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>My passion for art started when I realized that it fuses the physical with the abstract. I didn&#39;t know that in those terms, but I understood that beauty (good photography) is achieved by combining different ideas and techniques (rules, use of camera, use of light, use of color, use of mechanisms, taste, ingenuity, creativity, and even mathematics). I was always drawn to those things without knowing it. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>Photography was another medium for me to create using all of those things I always loved. I also didn&#39;t know in these terms until I read Emmanuel Kant&#39;s work.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>The same happened with programming. I remember seeing code a few times and thinking it probably was super tedious and hard to do because one would have to memorize a lot of stuff, but when I was introduced to it, I felt something in my stomach that made me feel powerful and happy at the same time.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>Learning and improving my skills has always been my passion. Consequently, I got into cars, video games, literature, billiards, and other things that stimulate my mind</p>
